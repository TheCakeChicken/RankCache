# Whitehill RankCache

Whitehill RankCache is a library designed to make it easier to obtain up-to-date group ranking information across all of your in-game scripts.

**Why use this over :GetRankInGroup/:GetRoleInGroup?**
- This library ensures that you get up-to-date rank information whilst keeping API requests to a minimum.
- It provides full control over when rank data is refreshed.

⚠️ Knowledge of Roblox scripting is required to use this library.

### Method 3: Rojo

## Basic Usage
```lua
local rankCache = require(game:GetService('ReplicatedStorage').RankCache)

-- Fetches Player1's rank for group 1234
local player1Rank = rankCache:GetPlayerRank(game.Players.Player1, 1234)

-- Fetches Player1's role for group 1234
local player1Role = rankCache:GetPlayerRole(game.Players.Player1, 1234)

-- Fetches Player2's rank for the configured default group
local player2Rank = rankCache:GetPlayerRank(game.Players.Player2)

-- Fetches Player2's role for the configured default group
local player2Role = rankCache:GetPlayerRole(game.Players.Player2)
```

More examples are available in the [examples](https://github.com/WhitehillGroup/RankCache/tree/main/examples) folder.

If you haven't added the group id, you can modify Line 42
```lua
local config = {
	--// Specifies the group ID to use when no groupId is provided
	DefaultGroupID = 0;
}
```
